Projects completed during M.Eng Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland

## ENPM 691 - Hacking of C Programs and Unix Binaries
*This project was completed for the ENPM 691 - Hacking of C Programs and Unix Binaries*

- Replicated buffer overflow vulnerability for remote shell execution in audacity 1.2.6 on Windows 10 
- Used static code analyzers to examine the code and identified the usage of 3 prohibited functions
- Achieved the highest distinction among over 20 projects in the class for this project 

## ENPM 809J - Cloud Security
*This project was completed for the ENPM809J - Cloud Security Final*

- This is a technical plan/road map for moving the application to the cloud for the organization Cobra Kai. The suggested plan takes into account things like resiliency, identity and access management (IAM), protecting data, compliance, secure system administration and coding practices.
- This is a technical document and presents detailed recommendations on HOW to implement the plan to migrate the Cobra Kai application to the cloud
- The document also contains things like Security Group/NACL/firewall rule configurations, detailed IAM policies/roles, sample CloudFormation templates, etc
- The target audience for this would be security architects/engineers and system admins/DevOps people so this should be a highly technical document

## ENPM 809Q - Penetration Testing
*This project was completed for the ENPM809Q - Penetration Testing Final*

#### Problem Statement - 
The Masked DJ is a worldwide phenomenon. They have quickly taken the world by storm rising to the top of the world most popular DJ lists replacing well known DJs like Carl Cox, Fatboy Slim, Diplo, and Tiesto. Playing to sellout crowds all over the world nightly The Masked DJ has gained their following by hiding behind a mask and getting club goers to return to focusing on the music.
The Masked DJ is planning to have an “unmasked” party at the start of 2022 where they will play for the first time without the mask with all proceeds from the event and associated silent auction going to charity. There is a great concern that a leak of who The Masked DJ is before the event could lead to people not showing up and the charity event being a disaster.
You and your group have been hired as a pen testing firm to see if you can break into The Masked DJ’s IT environment and discover photos of who The Masked DJ is. These photos are stored on a development version of The Masked DJ’s website and show The Masked DJ when they were much younger. You are also to make recommendations on how The Masked DJ’s IT team should lockdown and improve their overall IT security.
The Masked DJ has a small office team who perform the office needs for The Masked DJ. 
- A booking manager who books events and travel for The Masked DJ 
- An IT manager who runs the IT infrastructure
- A webmaster (currently on leave) who set up the initial IT environment and runs The Masked DJ’s website. They have grant plans for a new version of the site to be launched just after the “unmasked” party.

#### Task - 
Write up a professional looking report document how you moved through the environment to solve this final as well as recommendations for The Masked DJ to secure their IT environment. This will test your ability to enumerate, exploit, pivot, use password attacks, and use post exploitation tools to solve it.
