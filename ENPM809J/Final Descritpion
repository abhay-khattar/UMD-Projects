This project was completed for the ENPM809J - Cloud Security Final

This is a technical plan/road map for moving the application to the cloud for the organization Cobra Kai. The suggested plan takes into account things like resiliency, identity and access management (IAM), protecting data, compliance, secure system administration and coding practices.
This is a technical document and presents detailed recommendations on HOW to implement the plan to migrate the Cobra Kai application to the cloud
The document also contains things like Security Group/NACL/firewall rule configurations, detailed IAM policies/roles, sample CloudFormation templates, etc
The target audience for this would be security architects/engineers and system admins/DevOps people so this should be a highly technical document
